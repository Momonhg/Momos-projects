<h1>From customer service to be a coder</h1>
Thank you for reading this site. <br>
I started this because I just learn how to code and I want to share my journey.
So I created this page. A page of random logs of a 26 years old about her careers and to see how it goes.
Please note this is not a daily basis notes. Just a page with random logs about her career-wise.
I believe I am not a good writer and also not a perfect English speaker. So my apologize for my grammar and weird vocabulary.

  Dream to be <br>
  Born and raised in Vietnam, I always wanted to be a tour guide and to travel around the world. I love travel and to meet people and to discover new places.
  After highschool, I asked my parents to go Switzerland to study and no surprise my major was Hospitality and Business Management.
  The first two years, I learnt about basic hotels and restaurants management and everything surround it. like how to be a good customer service provider,
  how to control or upsell, increase revenue for hotels per night or how to manage turn over rate through high/ low season.
  Everything was to prepare the third year of the bachelor degree. Frankly, it was not hard or not challenge enough for me since everything you need to do was
  attend to classes, and read enough malterial to do reports and assignments. I am more practical person.
  My degree allowed me to go internship or co-op. I was a waitress, a receptionist and housekeeping. All three positions gave me the whole idea of hospitality concepts.
  It was fun, tired, amazing and exhausted for 18 years old girl. I finished my last internship in 2017 as a housekeeping. The favorite one as well since the whole team was amazing.
  I honestly believe that housekeeping department is far way more important than any department in hotel due to several reasons. They are like secret agents and protect the whole world with their duties.
  They are the one creates the whole feelings just like home and beyond. Sometimes you can even linger because their service they provide is like a butler of the house.
  At the end of the internship, I honestly dream to be a housekeeper manager in the future.
